Replies generating conversation are 150x more valuable. Engagement velocity in first 30 minutes is the single biggest factor. Grok AI now monitors tone — positive/empowering content gets wider distribution, negative/combative tone gets suppressed even with high engagement. External links = death for non-Premium accounts. X Premium gives 6x more impressions (600 vs <100).",

Read this.' / 'Marcus Aurelius wrote one line that changed everything.' DIRECT ADDRESS: 'You already know what you need to do. You're just afraid.' / 'Your silence is your power.

SCRIPT STRUCTURE: Short rhythmic lines building emotional tension. Build to resolution/payoff. End with quotable line (drives shares). LENGTHS: TikTok 30-60s, IG Reels 15-30s (sweet spot), IG Carousels 7-10 slides. SECONDARY: Text-on-screen quotes (15-20s, designed for looping).",
